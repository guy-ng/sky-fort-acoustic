# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-29)

**Core value:** Reliably detect and classify drones acoustically in real time, publishing target events over ZeroMQ so downstream systems can act on them.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — rest-api-and-live-monitoring-ui

## Current Position

Phase: 02 (rest-api-and-live-monitoring-ui) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 3
Status: Executing Phase 02
Last activity: 2026-03-31 -- Completed 02-01 REST/WebSocket API endpoints

Progress: [##........] 20%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- PyTorch over TensorFlow for CNN (research recommendation -- existing .h5 model cannot be reused, retraining required)
- Custom SRP-PHAT over Acoular (POC's 180-line implementation is simpler and sufficient for 4x4 array)
- Callback-based sounddevice.InputStream over blocking sd.rec() (irreversible architecture decision)
- [Phase 01]: Ring buffer uses one-slot-reserved circular pattern for full/empty disambiguation
- [Phase 01]: AudioCapture callback does only np.copyto + monotonic timestamp -- no logging in audio thread
- [Phase 01]: Elevation test relaxed for planar array -- UMA-16v2 has zero z-baseline, poor elevation discrimination is physics, not a bug
- [Phase 01]: Frequency band test uses variance comparison due to GCC-PHAT magnitude normalization
- [Phase 02]: Map data transposed to [elevation][azimuth] row-major for canvas rendering
- [Phase 02]: WebSocket heatmap uses JSON handshake then binary float32 frames
- [Phase 02]: Heatmap 20 Hz poll, targets 2 Hz matching data change rates

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Doppler speed estimation feasibility uncertain (UMA-16v2 aperture may be too small -- validate during Phase 3)
- UMA-16v2 channel mapping needs empirical verification (tap test) before beamforming work
- Callback-based capture not yet proven with UMA-16v2 (prototype early in Phase 1)
